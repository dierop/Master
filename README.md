# Master: MUIARFID

Source code repository for the [UPV](https://www.upv.es/) master [MUIARFID](https://www.upv.es/titulaciones/MUIARFID/): MÃ¡ster Universitario en Inteligencia Artificial, Reconocimiento de Formas e Imagen Digital .

This repository contains the source code for various subjects covered in the master course. Each folder represents a different subject.

The course is divided in three blocks of subjects and the subjects are based on 4 different branches: Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition, Computational Linguistics, and Digital Imaging. I have selected the first three branches.

## Subjects
**BLOCK 1**
- [LC](LC/README.md)
- [GPC](GPC/README.md)
- [RFA](RFA/README.md)
- [TMH](TMH/README.md)

Each subject folder contains its own `README.md` file with detailed information and instructions related to that subject.

Feel free to explore and use from the code provided in each subject folder.
