# ‚ú® RFA: Reconocimiento de Formas y Aprendizaje Autom√°tico

Source code for RFA subject.

The main focus are the usage of [Keras](https://keras.io/).

The project is developed over a dataset for [Diabetic Retinopathy](Rami/Diabetic_Retinopathy_Preprocessed_Dataset_256x256) based on one from Kaggle but preprocessed.

>[!Note]
> The fifth notebook is the main focus of the subject.

>[!Warning]
> The notebooks are prepared to be run over Google Colab. Some dependencies will be missing if you run it on local.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

To install it you just need to run the following command in an environment with Python
3.10 or higher with [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) installed:

`poetry install`

Finally, in order to run the static code analysis checks you should use the following
set of commands once installed:

```
poetry run ruff --fix .
poetry run black .
```
